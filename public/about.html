<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hello! I'm a B.Tech student passionate about technology, learning, and creating meaningful digital experiences.<br> I'm currently focused on web development and building a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.<br> I’ve already created a basic portfolio using HTML and am now exploring more advanced frontend and backend tools.</p>

<p>I have hands-on experience with Python and SQL, and I've built projects like a music recommendation system and an e-commerce platform using Python-MySQL integration. These projects helped me understand how to turn ideas into working applications and deepened my interest in software development.</p>

<p>I'm especially curious about fields like AI, machine learning, and UI/UX design. I enjoy problem-solving, learning by building, and constantly pushing myself to improve. Outside of tech, I'm passionate about music and sports.<br>I love singing, playing instruments, and have even won a table tennis medal for my college.
I’m currently learning and growing, one project at a time, and looking forward to collaborating, exploring new technologies, and creating tools that can make a difference.</p>
